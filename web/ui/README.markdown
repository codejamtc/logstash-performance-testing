# Logstash benchmarks UI

This application provides a UI for the continuous benchmarks
for the [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash) project.

The visualizations are implemented in [D3.js](http://d3js.org),
and jQuery is used for the interactivity.

Integration tests using Cucumber and PhantomJS are contained
in the `test` folder.
